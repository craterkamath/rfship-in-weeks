# Journal of my Research Fellow Stint with MSR

This page contains important milestones(according to me) in my journey as an RF :octocat:

Site is live at [vinayakakamath.me/rfship-in-weeks](https://vinayakakamath.me/rfship-in-weeks)

### Improvements/Changes over the forked repository

- Daily cells instead of weekly ones
- 1x3 grid arrangement for Legend, Calendar and Create your own Calendar
- The week always starts with Monday irrespective of your starting date
- Sorts legend by starting timestamp for clutter free view

### TODOs

- [ ] Add a panoramic view along with grid view
- [ ] Ability to export and import json data
- [ ] Color Pallete display for reference
- [ ] Add support for items other than spans


This work is inspired by Rishab's teachings:
> You cannot got where you want to if you don't know where you've already been
